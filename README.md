All retainrelease.me code is licensed under the APL (Alcohol Public License).  

The APL was written one drunken night in Tokyo, and the full text is lost to the world now, but basically, the APL states that you are free to use this code however you want, but only under two conditions:

1) You must be willing to buy me free drinks should we ever run into one another in a bar.  
2) You can't be a total asshole.
3) Under no conditions may you use this code on mars.  

(note: provision #3 is utterly non negotioable.  Don't ask why, you don't want to know)
